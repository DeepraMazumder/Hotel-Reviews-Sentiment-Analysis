# 🏨 NPN Cognizant Hackathon - Hotel Sentiment Analysis 🏆

Welcome to our **Hotel Sentiment Analysis** project for the **NPN Cognizant Hackathon**! This repository contains all the necessary components to scrape, analyze, and predict sentiment from hotel reviews.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Our project focuses on **predicting sentiment** from hotel reviews using a combination of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. We aim to provide a robust solution that can assist hotels in understanding guest satisfaction through automated sentiment analysis.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. Clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/NPN-Cognizant-Hackathon.git
cd NPN-Cognizant-Hackathon
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

1. **Scrape Data**: Use the web scraper to collect hotel reviews.
   ```bash
   python Web_Scraping/scraper.py
   ```

2. **Run Analysis**: Execute the Jupyter notebook to train models and analyze sentiments.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Hotel_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

3. **Make Predictions**: Use the `prediction.py` script to predict sentiments from new data.
   ```bash
   python src/prediction.py
   ```

4. **Deploy the App**: Deploy the Streamlit web app to showcase your results.
   ```bash
   streamlit run templates/streamlit/app.py
   ```

## 🧠 Model Overview

- **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model for comparison.
- **Naive Bayes**: Quick and interpretable model.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method to capture complex patterns.
- **LightGBM & XGBoost**: Gradient boosting models for high accuracy.

## 📈 Results

Our models have been fine-tuned and evaluated to achieve high accuracy in predicting sentiment from hotel reviews. Detailed results can be found in the notebook.
